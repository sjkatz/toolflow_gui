GUI Requirements from SKA
=====
1. Firstly we would need a block diagram based GUI, with a list of blocks that can be dragged into a design area. (Similar to the current Matlab/Simulink setup)
2. These blocks need to be able to support ports and parameters, and have a description of what the block does.
3. Obviously it must have the ability to connect up blocks with "wires"
4. Blocks will need to be able to be resized.
5. The GUI will have to redraw blocks on a parameter change. As a parameter can change the number of I/O ports on a block.
6. It would be very useful to have colour coded blocks, ie interfaces (controllers), primitives, DPS blocks etc
7. A neat way of doing the GUI would be as a web server. So it could be run on a server and you could do all your design through a browser. Alternately ssh -X could be used.
8. Provide the ability to group a number of blocks together to create another block. See the Simulink subsystem functionality.
9. Grouping of wires into buses.
10. Labeled bus widths on the wires, and possibly auto propagation of these bit widths between blocks. (Partially a design-flow requirement)
11. The GUI could also provide a view of the project source code, in a similar style to eclipse, where one can follow instantiations back to the implementation of modules and visa-versa.
12. The GUI must show real-time any syntax errors in the project code, similar to the way eclipse handles Java projects.
13. The compilation and synthesis tools must be hooked into the GUI and able to be run from with in the design-flow.
